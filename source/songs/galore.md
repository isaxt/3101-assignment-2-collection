# Welcome to My Blog 🎉

This is my very first blog post! I’m experimenting with Eleventy and Markdown to see how everything comes together.  

## What I’ll Be Writing About

- Notes from class  
- Coding experiments  
- Things I find inspiring  
- Occasional random thoughts  

## Why Blogging?

I’ve always liked the idea of keeping a space that feels like a notebook, but public. It’s a way to share what I’m learning while keeping track of my own process.  

> “The best way to learn is to teach.”  

Thanks for visiting! Stay tuned for more updates soon.
